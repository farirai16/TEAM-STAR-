            <h2 class="Titles"> Why is Amal Clooney an inspirational woman?</h2>
            <p class="paragraphs"> Amal Clooney is an inspirational woman to me in the scale and  global nature of the cases she takes on, those on behalf of female victims of mass atrocities including genocide and sexual and gender-based violence. Her representation of states to help receive justice for victims of genocide, and her work representing imprisoned journalists to encourage and further democracy in those countries. The use of her increased influence that she has as the wife of the famous actor George Clooney to continue to shine a light on her clients cases is commendable. Time magazine agrees as Amal was voted one of Time's Women of the Year 2022:
